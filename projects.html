                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-5">On 11 March 2020, UEDA facilitated a meeting with DTIC and Businesses along the D57 Road in Winterton to motivate for its upgrade from gravel to tar road. Businesses along this road have an approximate combined turnover of over 500 million Rand. They own a fleet of vehicles and trucks with an average load of 30 and 55 tons respectively. The gravel road is unable to accommodate this amount of tonnage. Businessmen who attended the meeting stated that the road becomes muddy and slippery during the rainy season which renders it inaccessible, and trucks and vehicles become stuck needing to be towed at an extra expense for the businesses and community members. The road is narrow and this makes it difficult for trucks travelling in opposite directions to pass each other.&nbsp;</h3>

The value of this project is R6 Billion and will create approximately 6000 job opportunities. The project started about 9 years ago.

The project has had serious delays especially from the Department of Mineral and Energy. All the studies have been completed by the investor. The Agency called a meeting with all the relevant stakeholders so as to fast-track the activities. The investor reported in the meeting that he was no longer moving ahead with the power station construction but was rather focusing on gasification.

The project is valued at R20 Billion and will create about 8000 job opportunities in the area.

</div><div>There have been serious delays in this project which were caused by changes in the structure of SINOSA. Other challenges were caused by the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development delaying to give land to the investor. The investor had to find a valuator for the land which has happened. The investor is now busy negotiating with the current lessees and tenants so that they can be moved and the EIA processes will take place.

One of those opportunities involved chicory planting which is currently imported from India. Previously there were attempts by Nestle to help farmers especially from the Weenen area to plant chicory. The project failed due to mishandling. The project has a great opportunity and can help in reducing the imports. The Agency has embarked on reviving this project and has met with all the relevant stakeholders including Nestle and ADA who provided the funding.
